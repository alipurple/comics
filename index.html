				<h2>Come Up with a Comic Book Idea in 4 Steps</h2>
				<ul>
					<li class="space">Think of a short story idea that would work well visually. You want large, easy-to-define moments and larger-than-life characters and a lot of dialogue. If you are already working on a novel, try adapting your characters and setting to comic form as a creativity exercise.</li>
					<li class="space">Next, work out the rough structure of your comic book. Think about the grand opening, the big plot points, the climax, and the resolution.</li>
					<li class="space">Write brief personality profiles of your main characters. Who are they? What do they want? What are their strengths and weaknesses? Where do they start out, and where do they end up at the end of your story? What central conflict do they all face, and overcome?</li>
					<li class="space">Think of extraordinary settings and strong, powerful emotions like love, death, anger, good, evil. How are these represented in your comic book?</li>
