				<h2>Structure a Comic Book in 3 Steps</h2>
				<p>Like films and other narrative art forms, most comic books tend to follow a three-act structure.</p>
				<ul class="numbered">
					<li class="space"><b>Act 1:</b> Introduction to the central characters, as well as the comic bookâ€™s setting, mood, and dominant conflict.</li>
					<li class="space"><b>Act 2:</b> Character development, individual story arcs, setbacks, challenges, what is learned, and finally, the climax.</li>
					<li class="space"><b>Act 3:</b> The post-climax resolution in which the characters undergo a transformation following what they have learned from their ordeal.</li>
				</ul>
