				<h2>Outline a Comic Book in 6 Steps</h2>
				<p>The following step-by-step guide for outlining comic books comes from award-winning author Neil Gaiman’s MasterClass.</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="space">Gather paper. Anywhere from a handful to 15 sheets and staple the pieces down the spine.</li>
					<li class="space">Create a numbered list of your pages. This will help give you an idea of what should go on each page. As long as you have a beginning and end jotted down, you’ll be able to navigate the rest.</li>
					<li class="space">Determine the beats of your story. A good starting point is to allocate one page per beat, though some beats can occupy more pages. Jot down the story beats next to the corresponding page numbers.</li>
					<li class="space">Turn story beats into panels. Starting at the beginning, determine how you will use each panel to tell that specific part of your story. Be mindful of the amount and type of information you need to present on each page and try to attribute space accordingly (play with panel size to give more room for beats like establishing shots and less room for beats that don’t need to present as much detail).</li>
					<li class="space">Sketch out action and note dialogue. These sketches are seen by you and you only; they can be stick figures or symbols, as long as they make sense to you and show an estimate of what should be in each panel. Think of what your dialogue needs to do to help the reader transition from panel to panel. Write notes to accompany the images in each panel.</li>
					<li class="space">Write your script! Using your thumbnails as a reference, write a script for your story which will eventually be turned over to your artist. Work panel by panel communicating things like framing, point-of-view, scene and character description, and dialogue. Think of this script as a letter to your artist in which you give them all of the information they will need to visually create the story you have in your head.</li>
